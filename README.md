# Sample of PyTorchXLA using gSPMD being analyzed with XProf

This repo contains a sample MNIST example using gSPMD. I will then be adding information on how to use XProf to analyze the model.

To set-up your environment, I recomment you follow https://github.com/pytorch/xla/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md
